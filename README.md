# Fraud detection with Machine Learning model


In this project, we create a predictive model to detect fraud in financial transactions. We will use the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains 284,807 transactions carried out by credit cards, 492 of which are frauds. It is highly unbalanced, which brings an interesting challenge.

## Problem Statement:

Company ABC, a major credit card company, faces challenges with their existing fraud detection system. The current system exhibits slow responsiveness in recognizing new patterns of fraud, leading to significant financial losses. To address this issue, they have contracted us to design and implement an algorithm that can efficiently identify and flag potentially fraudulent transactions for further investigation. The data provided consists of two tables: "cc_info," containing general credit card and cardholder information, and "transactions," containing details of credit card transactions that occurred between August 1st and October 30th.
