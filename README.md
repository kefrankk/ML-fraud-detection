# Fraud detection with Machine Learning model


In this project, we create a predictive model to detect fraud in financial transactions. We will use the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains 284,807 transactions carried out by credit cards, 492 of which are frauds. It is highly unbalanced, which brings an interesting challenge.
